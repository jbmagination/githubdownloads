In 2012, GitHub [removed the Downloads tab](https://github.blog/2012-12-12-goodbye-uploads/). They're still accessible via the Downloads API; however, said API, and the files with it, could vanish at any time.

This repository has the goal of archiving as many of these downloads as possible in a clean and simple manner.

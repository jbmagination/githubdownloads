The `downloads` directory is probably where you'll want to be if you're wishing to add to the archive.
* `https://api.github.com/[username]/[repository]` has the repository ID (attribute `id`)
* `https://api.github.com/[username]/[repository]/downloads` is what `[repository ID]/files.json` is based off of (the JSON file removes attributes `url`, `html_url`, `download_count`, and `content_type`)

If you're wanting to make a change to the website, `index.html` is where you'll find that ~~alongside my awful code~~.

If you are with/for a repository, can prove your relations, and would like to have your repository removed from the dataset, please make an issue.

If you are from GitHub, and would like this repository removed, **please also make an issue and let me know!** I really do appreciate this place and don't want to get on your bad side. 

Regardless of whether you're from GitHub or from a repository, this is an effort to keep many downloads available for the foreseeable future; I mean no harm. I will definitely try to convince you to let it stay available, but I'm not unreasonable and am willing to take it down if you insist.
